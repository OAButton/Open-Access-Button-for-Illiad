# Open Access Button for Illiad

Currently pre-alpha (aka, it likely won't work), with next to no idea if this will actually work. We can test without an Illiad institution actually installing. Currently based on this [Google Scholar add-on](https://prometheus.atlas-sys.com/display/ILLiadAddons/*ILLiad+Google+Scholar+Search+Addon). Should be active by default, and so just show the results page.

If successful, it'll look something like the below (but in the ILLiad interface).
